# Hash cracking with John the ripper
## Overview
**Ever heard of hashing?**  
The 8th wonder of the world.

Have you ever wondered how organizations that manage millions of login credentials securely store passwords?  
Or why older hashing algorithms like **MD5** are no longer considered secure?

In this project, I’ll demonstrate the risks of weak hashing by:

- Creating a list of common passwords  
- Hashing them using the **MD5** algorithm  
- Cracking those hashes using **John the Ripper**, a powerful password cracking tool

This project is a hands-on way to understand why MD5 has been phased out and how attackers can exploit weak cryptographic protections.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is strictly for educational purposes. It is designed to raise awareness about poor security practices and promote better password storage techniques
