## Objectives: 
The purpose of the project is to gain hands on skills with Surricata by practicing basic Incident Simulation and response. It will include the following:
Installing Surricata
Configuring Surricata
Creating Surricata rules
Network Intrusion detection with suricata

### Tools Used
Not taking to account the Hypervisor(VMware) the tools I'll be using in this project are:
