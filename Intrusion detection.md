# Intrusion detection with Suricata

## Objectives: 
The purpose of the project is to gain hands on skills with Surricata by practicing basic Incident Simulation and response. It will include the following:
- Installing Surricata
- Configuring Surricata
- Creating Surricata rules
- Network Intrusion detection with suricata

### Tools Used
Not taking to account the Hypervisor(VMware) the tools I'll be using in this project are:
- Surricata: What did you expect the name of the project is literally intrusion detection with Surricata 
- Atttack simulation tool: Undecided

### Acknowledgments: This project was made possible through hackersploits Surricata guide video over on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91i7InHVOso&t=464s).
